# "Experience"
Chief architect of recursive abstraction for hypothetical solutions and theoretical implementation in the realm of post-ironic digital transformation. Former principal evangelist at vaporware development of situational systematic dependence and programmatic regression analysis. Lead team lead at corpcorp. 

# Currently Learning
- Industrial confusion & deliberately obtuse nomenclature
- Force push and pray
- Pre-emptive debugging (fixing bugs before writing the code)
- Aggressive optimization of console.log() statements
- verose abstraction (in the general sense as it applies to cubic regression)
- liquification
- analytical analysis
- Ducks (the web-footed quacking ones)

If 'spaghetti-code' ever becomes an official design pattern I'll deadass switch to programming exclusively in Shell (actually might just adopt COBOL)
